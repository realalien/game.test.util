* not found any factory in buildbot start method call chain. AND 
  Q: what's the protocol used  Q: how the reactor.run without any info about the port and factory?
  Q:  Why buildbot has no factory-specific configuration of the protocols

  
  * FOR FUN: write a client to grabbing data constantly from douban to collect data.
  
  * Q: doc.p.18, did not find  any IProtocol class, is it a API change?

* Twisted doc, p.17, we have in class LogBotFactory, how did the class know  about the reactor
  and even call reactor.stop()?
 
* ESP. it takes time to get to know about Twisted details, 
  HINT &. TODO: most part of the Buildbot can be reused, so I think the easy way to get a 
        task done is rewriting the master side logic!
        
* Notes:
  
  
 * in service.py, line 276/271, in the class MultiService(Service):
 	Service.privilegedStartService(self)
 Q: what's the use of call super class's empty method 
 	and even iterate over self in the next line of code?
 A: 
 
 * TODO:research in debugging, what should be in the cfg file,
     we not listen to the source change.
     
     
 
 * IDEA: ideally, the detecting of buggy changelist should incorporate
    code with following functions, 
    e.g. receieve detailed/helpful info from reporters, to narrow
        down the range of changelist number
    e.g. inform the maintainer there is an alternative, like debugging
        by a dedicated programmer, it could be the best way of locating
        error
    e.g.  keep word search with error report and changelist description
    
    e.g. narrow the changelist selection by distribution of CL made by 
    	programmer, even depends on the content of CL, only UC or cpp?
    
    
    e.g. *** use pattern to apply different strategies in different 
     situasion. ( e.g. 1d back, 1 wk back, 1 mth back, .5 mth back checking)

* I think the new 'detector master' and 'detector slaves' should NOT 
  mingle with the other existing master and slaves, though the steps
  may be reused in locating buggy changelists.
  
× MOD HISTORY
  >>> runner.py  (facilities for create instances)--  Options,  
  >>> changes.py	(replacing ChangeMaster with master that grab all 
     changes at once, no need to periodically get new change.)
      --->  changes.* may be also rewrite.

* TODO: the TotalChangeMaster may require loading previous changelists
		using cPickle and merging new changelists, test out the perfo-
		rmance.

* TODO: see if or how to runtime inspect on Buildbot internals.


* Q: the BuggyChangelistDetector should not be fed with master.cfg
     but preferably, a

* IDEA:  I think there is no need to create a DetectorMaster configuration
   because the master info. can be always on-the-fly. 


* TASK: make enlarge/dis-enlarge widget.
